## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer          | Technology                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend**   | React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI        |

## ⚡ How It Works

1. **User asks a career-related query** (e.g., “Roadmap for ML Engineer”)
2. **AI Engine (Gemini)** processes the query
3. **Backend (FastAPI)** returns structured responses (roadmaps, skills, salary insights)
4. **Frontend (React)** displays interactive cards, tabs, and resources
